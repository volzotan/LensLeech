00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:07,860
Cameras are used as the primary input device  for a wide range of interaction techniques at  

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:13,800
various distances, yet they are constrained by  geometry and require a minimum focal distance. 

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:21,000
We present the LensLeech, a deformable silicone  attachment that enables On-Lens Interaction and  

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,519
can be placed directly on a camera to measure  translation, rotation, and deformation. 

5
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:32,880
This is done by fabricating a clear silicone  body with a lens surface to focus light from the  

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,780
opposing surface. The resulting image is always in  focus even when the silicone attachment is closer  

7
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:46,380
to the camera than the minimum focal distance  of the lens. On the top surface is a color-coded  

8
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:52,380
marker pattern that allows to uniquely identify  each point even when the material is deformed. 

9
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,000
Based on the marker points we can  sense four basic interaction patterns. 

10
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,820
The silicone body can be pushed  sideways and used like a joystick. 

11
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:06,780
It can be rotated around the optical axis. 

12
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,019
Pressed like a button, and squeezed. 

13
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:21,479
We present application examples using the  LensLeech and various addons for existing devices: 

14
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,739
For small, body-worn cameras like action cameras  

15
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:29,879
or lifeloggers with a wide-angle lens  but little physical space for buttons,  

16
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:34,619
the LensLeech can provide the functionality  of a tangible knob to change settings. 

17
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,079
With large cameras and interchangeable lenses,  the silicone can be integrated into a lens cap,  

18
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:47,640
making it easy to quickly traverse  large amounts of captured images  

19
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:54,719
on old devices with no touchscreens. However, optical attachments can not only  

20
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:01,140
provide input. When combining the LensLeech with a  set of lenses, a prism, and a beamsplitter, we can  

21
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:07,079
create a hybrid viewfinder. That's a completely  passive smartphone photography add-on that slides  

22
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:12,539
over the display. Visual output is provided  by redirecting a section of the smartphone  

23
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:18,359
screen into an optical viewfinder, providing  a digital overlay over the viewfinder image.  

24
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,780
The rear camera remains unobstructed for the  task of taking pictures while the LensLeech  

25
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,759
can make use of the front camera to change  settings and act as a shutter release button. 

26
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:37,680
In general, the proposed concept has several  beneficial properties. Silicone attachments are a  

27
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,280
simple, inexpensive way of enabling rich, tangible  interaction directly on or above an otherwise  

28
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:50,819
unused camera lens. The silicone is soft and will  not damage glass elements or coatings of lenses. 

29
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:55,199
It requires no hardware modifications  of existing or future devices  

30
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,700
and it is unpowered, requiring  only ambient illumination.
